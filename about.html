      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Let me introduce myself.</p>
      <p>My name is Rienk Bezema, a social worker with a preference for work that includes contact with people and a good amount of research. I'm knowledgeable and experienced in matters of legal support concerning refugees in the Netherlands.<br><br> People
        know me as a friendly person who is not easily stressed. I'm also someone who is eager to learn and well able to work solo and/or in a team.<br> I'm a good colleague and integrity is important in my book.<br><br> Besides human interest in political
        and the legal side of working with refugees I'm also interested in the political and legal side of the organisation of care for people with financial difficulties.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm not a person who works by the clock and thinks gaining profit (money-wise) is the main goal during life. In my various jobs I have noticed that understanding one and another is worth taking time for and showing interest is valuable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Coding and web development is an entirely new career path for me. I'm still a novice and studying hard to become a more knowledgeable and efficient web developer.
        <p>I would like to develop webpages where people are able to find help quickly and accessible (understandable) information when confronted with financial problems.</p>
