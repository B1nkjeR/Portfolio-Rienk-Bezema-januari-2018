      <h1>CodeGorilla</h1>
      <br>
      <p>CodeGorilla is a company that focuses on bringing people, from all kinds of background, to the work-floor of companies in the job function of Trainee Junior Web Developer. Some of these future trainees are entirely new at coding and IT.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In a period of just four months trainees are learned the basics of writing code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The trainees are also given the opportunity to learn extra coding-languages like PHP, Python and C#.</p>
      <p>There's also time to learn how to work with an text-editor (Atom), how to use GitHub for own or joined projects, how to cooperate with each other and how to use meeting-tools like Scrum.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>“Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.” - -

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>The overall thought is that knowledge is everywhere. So it is encouraged to learn from each other, to help each other, search and find solutions - using (for instance) forums and video (tutorials on YouTube) on the internet and really sparsely ask for
        help from the coaches.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Just about four weeks into training the trainees form groups to work together on real projects for real clients. Using coding skills and 21th century learning skills they will come up with a Minimum Viable Product that meets the wishes of their
        client.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The work environment is set up to resemble a coding company. So there are a lot of deliberate changes in time-schedules and plans. This set up will help trainees adjust to working in a company.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The trainees will spend the last four weeks to work on their showcases in which they can show their ability to code. During this period chances are that trainees will have to go to job application interviews (arranged and set up by CodeGorilla)
        and hopefully find a job in coding. </p>
